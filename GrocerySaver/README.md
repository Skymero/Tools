# GrocerySaver

A Selenium-based Python project that reads a list of grocery items from a text file, searches Albertsons, Fry's, and Walmart for each item, and outputs a CSV file comparing prices.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create `items.txt` with one grocery item per line.

3. Configure `config.py` if needed (file paths and URLs).

## Usage

```bash
python grocery_saver.py
```
