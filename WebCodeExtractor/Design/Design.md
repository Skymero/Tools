# Project Overview
- Name: Turborepo
- Type: Documentation and Marketing Website
- URL: https://turbo.build
- Description: Official website for Turborepo, a build system optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust.

# Technical Structure

## Frontend Framework
- **Next.js**: The site is built using Next.js, as evidenced by the script paths containing `_next/static/chunks` and component references in the code.
- **React**: Used as the underlying JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## CSS Framework
- **Tailwind CSS**: The site extensively uses Tailwind's utility-first CSS approach for styling.
- **Custom Properties**: Defines custom CSS variables (e.g., `--tw-*`) for consistent styling throughout the site.
- **Responsive Design**: Implements responsive breakpoints using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `lg:`, `md:`, `sm:`).
- **Dark Mode Support**: Uses Tailwind's dark mode variant (`dark:`) for theme switching.

## JavaScript Libraries and Functionality
- **Algolia Search**: Implements site-wide search functionality using Algolia.
- **Local Storage**: Used for persisting user preferences such as theme selection.
- **Vercel Analytics**: Integrated for website analytics and performance monitoring.

# Content Structure
