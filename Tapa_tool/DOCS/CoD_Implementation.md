# Tapa Tool Implementation and Debugging Log

## Task 1: Implement Component Requirements Extraction and Search Functionality

### **Problem Summary**
- The Tapa Tool needed the ability to extract component requirements from various document formats and search for matching parts on Mouser.com.
- The tool needed to check TAA compliance for found parts.
- Initial implementation encountered 403 Forbidden errors when trying to scrape Mouser.com.

**Error/Terminal Output:**
```
2025-03-31 16:12:38,687 - tapa_tool - ERROR - Failed to search Mouser. Status code: 403
No parts found for requirement REQ-004ERROR - Failed to search Mouser. Status code: 403
Searching for parts matching requirement REQ-005
2025-03-31 16:12:38,688 - tapa_tool - INFO - Built search query: TE Connectivity 1825232-1 Connector
2025-03-31 16:12:38,688 - tapa_tool - INFO - Searching Mouser with query: TE Connectivity 1825232-1 Connector
2025-03-31 16:12:38,882 - tapa_tool - ERROR - Failed to search Mouser. Status code: 403
No parts found for requirement REQ-005
```

- **Theory**: Mouser.com's anti-scraping protection was blocking our HTTP requests. The website may have changed its structure or increased its security measures.

- **What I've Tried**: 
  1. Updated the user agent and request headers
  2. Modified the search URL structure
  3. Added more sophisticated HTML parsing with multiple selector fallbacks
  4. Implemented a sample data mode for testing without live web access
  5. Added simulation of search results when live search fails

## Debug Log

**Codeium Response/Suggestion:**
- Updated the MouserScraper class to use modern selectors and URLs
- Added a fallback system to use simulated results for testing
- Created a sample data mode to use pre-existing JSON data instead of live searches
- Modified the output directory structure to better organize results

**Results:**
```
Error searching Mouser: Error 403 Forbidden
Using simulated parts for testing purposes only
```

**Next Codeium Response/Suggestion:**
- Created a dedicated JSON file containing sample TAA compliant parts for testing
- Modified the TAAComplianceChecker to use compliance data from the sample file
- Added new command-line option `--use-sample-data` to facilitate testing

**Results:**
```
Found 5 requirements
Saved requirements to C:\Users\ricky\Tools\Tapa_tool\OUTPUT_FILES\requirements.json
Using 5 sample parts from JSON file for testing
Found 5 TAA compliant parts out of 5 total parts
Results saved to C:\Users\ricky\Tools\Tapa_tool\OUTPUT_FILES
```

**Final Codeium Response/Suggestion:**
- Implemented official Mouser API integration to replace web scraping
- Added new command-line option `--mouser-api-key` to authenticate with the API
- Enhanced the search functionality to use both part number and keyword search
- Updated the TAAComplianceChecker to use country of origin data from the API

### Solution and Implementation

The Tapa Tool was implemented as a Python script with several key components:

1. **RequirementsExtractor Class**:
   - Parses different file formats (text, CSV, JSON) to extract component requirements
   - Identifies part numbers, descriptions, and specifications from semi-structured data
   - Returns a standardized dictionary of requirements for further processing

2. **MouserScraper Class**:
   - Initially implemented as a web scraper with BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML
   - Enhanced with proper fallbacks and error handling for when scraping fails
   - Further improved by adding official Mouser API integration:
     ```python
     def search_via_api(self) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
         """Search for parts on Mouser.com using the official API."""
         # API authentication and request handling
         search_payload = {
             "SearchByKeywordRequest": {
                 "keyword": query,
                 "records": 50,
                 "searchOptions": "InStock"
             }
         }
         # Process results and extract part data
     ```

3. **TAAComplianceChecker Class**:
   - Checks if parts are compliant with the Trade Agreements Act (TAA)
   - Looks for indicators of compliance like "TAA Compliant" or specific countries of origin
   - Enhanced to use pre-existing compliance data from sample files when available

4. **Main Script Logic**:
   - Implemented command-line argument parsing for flexible operation
   - Added multiple operation modes (live search, sample data)
   - Created structured output with CSV files and console tables
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

5. **Testing and Demo Capability**:
   - Created sample data files with known TAA compliant parts
   - Implemented simulation mode for reliable demos without API dependencies
   - Added detailed logging to track the execution flow

The implementation handles various error scenarios gracefully, with appropriate fallbacks to ensure the tool always provides useful output, even when external services are unavailable. The tool now has a robust framework that can be extended to support additional component sources beyond Mouser.com in the future.
